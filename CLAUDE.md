## Effect Best Practices

**IMPORTANT:** Always consult effect-solutions before writing Effect code.

1. Run `effect-solutions list` to see available guides
2. Run `effect-solutions show <topic>...` for relevant patterns (supports multiple topics)
3. Search `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect` for real implementations

Topics: quick-start, project-setup, tsconfig, basics, services-and-layers, data-modeling, error-handling, config, testing, cli.

Never guess at Effect patterns - check the guide first.

## Local Effect Source

The Effect v4 repository is cloned to `~/.local/share/effect-solutions/effect` for reference.
Use this to explore APIs, find usage examples, and understand implementation
details when the documentation isn't enough.

## UI Components

For UI work in this repo, use standard React JSX/TSX files.

- Prefer plain React function components and normal JSX control flow.
- Keep styling consistent with the existing Tailwind and UI wrapper patterns in
  `apps/web/src/components`.
